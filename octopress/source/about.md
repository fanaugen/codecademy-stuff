## About this blog
This little blog is used to publish stuff I made or contributed to as a [Codecademy][cc] user and forum moderator. I used to collect links to frequently asked Q&A Forum questions in an Evernote notebook, host some HTML pages in the Public folder of my Dropbox, and have some articles in the Wiki of my GitHub repository.

It was all a distributed mess. Now it’s all here in one place, neatly arranged for anyone who might find it useful:

- [Q&A Forum Answers](qa.html)
- [Articles](articles/index.html)
- [Code](code)
- [Blog](blog/archives)

Look at the footer for information on how this blog works technically.

## About me
