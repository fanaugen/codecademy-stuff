## About me
I’m a Codecademy enthusiast, because I enjoy teaching and sharing experience as well as learning from others.
I created a JavaScript course, [Method Chaining and ROT13](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-lesson-n1woS).

You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/fanaugen), [GitHub](https://www.github.com/fanaugen), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/alexjahraus/), and [about.me](http://about.me/alex.jahraus).
